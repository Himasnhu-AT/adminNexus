# Admin Nexus

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Under Development. Not ready for production use

Admin Nexus is a powerful and flexible admin dashboard designed to streamline the management of applications. Offering real-time insights, logging, feedback tracking, and more, it simplifies admin tasks while providing a user-friendly interface for monitoring application health, feedback, and data stats. This project is under active development and aims to provide an all-in-one solution for application management.

## Features

### Logging

Admin Nexus offers an intuitive logging system, allowing developers to send logs via SDKs or APIs. These logs are automatically stored on the server and can be accessed on demand through the Admin Nexus dashboard. This centralized logging solution helps you track and manage application logs more efficiently.

### Feedback and Bug Tracking

Managing user feedback and bug reports is easy with Admin Nexus. You can send feedback reports using our APIs or SDKs, and if a report contains a bug or feature request, our bot will automatically create corresponding GitHub issues. This ensures that all feedback is promptly tracked and addressed.

### Database Stats and Dashboards

Admin Nexus provides drag-and-drop dashboards for monitoring database metrics. You can track stats like user growth, activity levels, and posts per hour, offering actionable insights to help you make informed decisions. The dashboard makes it simple to visualize critical data points and monitor application performance.
